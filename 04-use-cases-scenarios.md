### Use vs. Avoid Guidelines

#### **Strongly Consider Event Sourcing When**:

- **Regulatory compliance** requires immutable audit trails
- **Complex business processes** with multiple state transitions
- **Temporal analysis** is a core business requirement
- **Integration with multiple systems** requires event notifications
- **Dispute resolution** needs complete historical context
- **Debugging complex workflows** is challenging with current state
- **Analytics and reporting** require historical data reconstruction

#### **Avoid Event Sourcing When**:

- **Simple CRUD applications** with minimal business logic
- **Immediate consistency** is absolutely critical
- **Team lacks experience** with event-driven architectures
- **Storage costs** are the primary constraint
- **Query patterns** are exclusively current-state focused
- **Rapid prototyping** with frequently changing requirements
- **Legacy system integration** is prohibitively complex

## Real-World Case Studies

## Anti-Patterns and Common Pitfalls

### Technical Anti-Patterns

#### 1. Event Store as Message Queue

**Anti-Pattern**: Using the event store for temporary messaging between services.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Service A] -->|Temporary Message| B[Event Store]
    B -->|Process & Delete| C[Service B]
    
    D[❌ Wrong Approach] --> A
```

**Correct Approach**: Use dedicated message queues for temporary communication, event stores for permanent business events.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Service A] -->|Business Event| B[Event Store]
    A -->|Temporary Message| C[Message Queue]
    C --> D[Service B]
    B --> E[Permanent Storage]
    
    F[✅ Correct Approach] --> A
```

#### 2. Oversized Events

**Anti-Pattern**: Including entire object state in events instead of just changes.

```json
// ❌ Anti-pattern: Oversized event
{
  "eventType": "CustomerUpdated",
  "customerId": "cust-123",
  "customerData": {
    // Entire customer object with 50+ fields
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    // ... 48 more fields that didn't change
  }
}
```

**Correct Approach**: Include only changed data and essential context.

```json
// ✅ Correct: Focused event
{
  "eventType": "CustomerEmailChanged",
  "customerId": "cust-123",
  "oldEmail": "john.old@example.com",
  "newEmail": "john.new@example.com",
  "changedBy": "user-456",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

#### 3. Projection Coupling

**Anti-Pattern**: Tightly coupling projections to specific event structures.

**Impact**: Difficult schema evolution and maintenance.

**Solution**: Use event versioning and projection adapters.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Event Evolution"
        A[Event V1] --> B[Projection Adapter]
        C[Event V2] --> B
        D[Event V3] --> B
        B --> E[Stable Projection]
    end
```

### Business Anti-Patterns

#### 1. Event Sourcing Everything

**Anti-Pattern**: Applying Event Sourcing to all parts of a system regardless of need.

**Problems**:
- Unnecessary complexity for simple operations
- Increased development and operational overhead
- Team cognitive load

**Solution**: Selective application based on business value and technical requirements.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Selective Event Sourcing"
        A[Core Business Domain] --> B[Event Sourcing]
        C[Supporting Services] --> D[Traditional CRUD]
        E[Reporting System] --> F[Read-Only Views]
        
        G[High Audit Requirements] --> B
        H[Simple Operations] --> D
        I[Analytics Only] --> F
    end
```

#### 2. Inadequate Event Modeling

**Anti-Pattern**: Technical events instead of business events.

```json
// ❌ Technical event
{
  "eventType": "DatabaseRowUpdated",
  "table": "customers",
  "rowId": 123,
  "changes": {"status": "active"}
}

// ✅ Business event
{
  "eventType": "CustomerActivated",
  "customerId": "cust-123",
  "activatedBy": "support-agent-456",
  "reason": "verification_completed"
}
```

### Operational Anti-Patterns

#### 1. Insufficient Monitoring

**Common Oversight**: Focusing only on functional requirements without operational observability.

**Essential Monitoring Metrics**:

| Metric Category | Key Metrics | Purpose |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Event Store Health** | Write latency, storage growth, error rates | Operational reliability |
| **Projection Performance** | Processing lag, rebuild times, error rates | Read model health |
| **Business Metrics** | Event volume by type, processing success rates | Business insights |
| **Infrastructure** | CPU, memory, disk I/O, network | Resource optimization |

#### 2. Inadequate Error Handling

**Anti-Pattern**: Failing silently when event processing fails.

**Solution**: Comprehensive error handling strategy.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Error Handling Strategy"
        A[Event Processing] --> B{Success?}
        B -->|Yes| C[Continue Processing]
        B -->|No| D[Retry Logic]
        D --> E{Retry Limit?}
        E -->|No| F[Exponential Backoff]
        F --> A
        E -->|Yes| G[Dead Letter Queue]
        G --> H[Alert Operations]
        H --> I[Manual Investigation]
    end
```

## Scenario-Based Comparisons

### Scenario 1: Customer Support System

**Business Context**: SaaS company with 100K+ customers needing comprehensive support ticket tracking.

#### Traditional CRUD Approach

```sql
-- Current state only
CREATE TABLE support_tickets (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id UUID,
    status VARCHAR(20),
    priority VARCHAR(10),
    assigned_to UUID,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    description TEXT
);
```

**Limitations**:
- No history of status changes
- Cannot track who made changes when
- Difficult root cause analysis
- Limited analytics capabilities

#### Event Sourcing Approach

```json
// Complete ticket lifecycle
[
  {
    "eventType": "TicketCreated",
    "ticketId": "ticket-123",
    "customerId": "cust-456",
    "priority": "high",
    "category": "billing",
    "description": "Cannot access premium features",
    "createdBy": "customer-portal",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T09:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    "eventType": "TicketAssigned",
    "ticketId": "ticket-123",
    "assignedTo": "agent-789",
    "assignedBy": "system-auto-assignment",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T09:02:00Z"
  },
  {
    "eventType": "TicketStatusChanged",
    "ticketId": "ticket-123",
    "fromStatus": "open",
    "toStatus": "in_progress",
    "changedBy": "agent-789",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:15:00Z"
  },
  {
    "eventType": "CustomerResponseAdded",
    "ticketId": "ticket-123",
    "responseText": "I tried the suggested solution...",
    "addedBy": "cust-456",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z"
  }
]
```

**Advantages**:
- Complete audit trail of all changes
- Customer interaction history
- Agent performance analytics
- Process optimization insights

#### Comparison Results

| Aspect | Traditional CRUD | Event Sourcing | Winner |

## Conclusion

Event Sourcing represents a powerful architectural pattern that excels in domains requiring comprehensive audit trails, complex business processes, and temporal analysis capabilities. However, its adoption requires careful evaluation of business requirements, team capabilities, and long-term strategic goals.

### Key Decision Factors

**Choose Event Sourcing when**:
- Audit trails and compliance are critical
- Business processes involve complex state transitions
- Historical analysis drives business value
- System integration requires event notifications
- Debugging and troubleshooting are challenging with current state

**Avoid Event Sourcing when**:
- Business requirements are simple and well-understood
- Team lacks experience with event-driven architectures
- Immediate consistency is absolutely required
- Storage costs are the primary constraint
- Rapid prototyping with changing requirements

### Implementation Success Factors

1. **Executive Sponsorship**: Ensure leadership support for the cultural and technical transition
2. **Team Preparation**: Invest in comprehensive training and knowledge transfer
3. **Phased Approach**: Start with pilot projects to build confidence and expertise
4. **Monitoring Investment**: Implement comprehensive observability from day one
5. **Business Alignment**: Maintain clear connection between technical implementation and business value

### Long-term Considerations

Event Sourcing is not just a technical decision—it's an architectural philosophy that affects how teams think about data, state, and system design. Organizations that successfully adopt Event Sourcing often find it becomes a competitive advantage, enabling rapid innovation, superior customer support, and robust compliance capabilities.

The key to success lies in careful evaluation of the decision frameworks provided in this document, honest assessment of organizational readiness, and commitment to the long-term journey of building event-driven systems.
