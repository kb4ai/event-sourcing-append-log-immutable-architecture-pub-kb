# META: Original Development Prompt

**Date:** 2025-07-02  
**Purpose:** Complete original user prompt for event sourcing knowledge base development

## Full Original Prompt

Update README.md , make more smaller scoped markdown files coveringing in scoped concise way different key ideas around architecture, design, origins, usecases, scenarious, etc, make also scoped markdown files in concise way illustrating architecutre, examples, implementation, illustrate with diagrams in mermaid, with markdown tables, etc, Please combine ideas from sources, and provide references to srouces, and cross reference documents with each other:

## Technical Implementation Strategy

Also realise that to do both keep reading via web fetch (and websearch) and also realise that we have downloaded materials under /home/gw-t490/kb/software-architecture-kb/immutable-patterns-kb/event-systems-kb/event-sourcing-append-log-immutable-architecture-pub-kb/references/web_resources_cache (and download more into this directory with jina.ai_reader -o auto -F content,markdown,...,url --url ...) ... and ofc commit in some "references cache" commit...

## TODO Development Methodology

Basically make TODO list:

* first, TODO items on researching and understanding contents of our /home/gw-t490/kb/software-architecture-kb/immutable-patterns-kb/event-systems-kb/event-sourcing-append-log-immutable-architecture-pub-kb/ repo with cached resources, and web fetch / jina ai collect organise read understand ....
* then TODO items tasks on sub-agents / sub-tasks with small scoped initial concise small scoped topic based documents
* then parallel sub-agents / sub-tasks each having focus on different file editing, investigating potential connections with others to augment with cross linking markdown files and eventual cross references
* then parallel sub-agents / sub-tasks looking for opproutnituies to deduplicate content across files and optimize
* then optimize content docuemnt so we have scoped cross references markdown documents on different topics creating nice graph of concepts with each other and nicely linking with each other
* each review analize update, so we have concice nice introduction for topic nicely chunked and easy to navigate for people with different interest in mind having differnt paths how to naviggate depending on their interest and sopce

## Final Vision

* basically consider README.md as repo /home/gw-t490/kb/software-architecture-kb/immutable-patterns-kb/event-systems-kb/event-sourcing-append-log-immutable-architecture-pub-kb/README.md landing page with concise attention capturing and eye opening pitch, and different questinos, interest captures, statemetns or thought provoking questions linking to different scoped documents in the repo, providing more thought provoking on insights or illustrations, tables, mermaid talbes, example storeis usecases diagrams, and linking to other documents to each other

## Status
âœ… COMPLETED - All objectives achieved through systematic TODO-driven development approach
