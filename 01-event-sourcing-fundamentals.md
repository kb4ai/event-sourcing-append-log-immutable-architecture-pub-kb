# Event Sourcing Fundamentals

## Definition and Core Principle

Event Sourcing is an architectural design pattern where **all changes to application state are stored as a sequence of immutable events** in an append-only log. Instead of storing the current state of entities, Event Sourcing captures the complete history of state-changing events, enabling the reconstruction of any past state by replaying events from the beginning of time.

**Core Principle**: The current state of any entity can be derived by replaying all events that have affected it, providing a complete audit trail and enabling powerful capabilities like time-travel debugging and state reconstruction.

## Key Characteristics

> **Deep Dive**: For detailed architectural implementations of these characteristics, see [Event Sourcing Architectural Patterns](02-architectural-patterns.md#core-architectural-components).

### Immutability
- Events are **never modified** after they are written
- Each event represents an immutable business fact
- Events are described in past tense (e.g., "CustomerRegistered", "OrderPlaced")
- Contains unique metadata and business context

### Append-Only Storage
- Events are stored chronologically in an append-only log
- No updates or deletes, only appends
- Write-optimized storage pattern
- Natural ordering guarantees

> **Implementation Details**: See [Append-Only Log Patterns](02-architectural-patterns.md#append-only-log-patterns) for technical implementation strategies and [Implementation Examples](03-implementation-examples.md#event-store-implementations) for concrete code examples.

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Events serve as the source of truth
- State is derived from events, not stored directly
- Supports publish/subscribe patterns
- Enables loose coupling between components

> **Architectural Patterns**: Learn about [Event-Driven Architecture Principles](02-architectural-patterns.md#event-driven-architecture-principles) and explore [Real-World Use Cases](04-use-cases-scenarios.md#event-driven-integration-scenarios).

### Time-Travel Capabilities
- Any historical state can be reconstructed
- Point-in-time queries and analysis
- Debugging by replaying events to specific moments
- Support for temporal queries

## Benefits and Advantages

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Complete Audit Trail** | Every change is recorded with full context |
| **Time-Travel Debugging** | Reconstruct any historical state for analysis |
| **Root Cause Analysis** | Trace the exact sequence of events leading to issues |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Immutable history survives system failures |
| **Scalability** | Append-only writes with optimized read projections |
| **Flexibility** | New projections can be built from existing events |
| **Asynchronous Processing** | Natural support for event-driven, async architectures |
| **Service Autonomy** | Services can maintain independent event streams |
| **Observability** | Rich insights into system behavior and state changes |

## Core Components

> **Implementation Guide**: For detailed implementation patterns and code examples of these components, see [Event Design Patterns](03-implementation-examples.md#event-design-patterns-and-schemas).

### 1. Events
- **Immutable business facts** representing state changes
- Contain all necessary data to understand what happened
- Include metadata (timestamp, version, causation ID)
- Named in past tense to reflect completed actions

### 2. Event Store
- **Append-only database** for storing events
- Optimized for sequential writes and reads
- Provides ordering guarantees within streams
- Supports efficient querying by entity or time range

> **Architecture Deep Dive**: See [Event Store Architecture](02-architectural-patterns.md#event-store-architecture) for design principles and [Event Store Implementations](03-implementation-examples.md#event-store-implementations) for technology-specific examples.

### 3. Event Streams
- **Ordered sequences of events** for specific entities
- Identified by unique stream IDs (typically entity IDs)
- Contain the complete history of an entity's changes
- Enable efficient loading of entity history

### 4. Projections
- **Read models** derived from events
- Temporary and disposable views of data
- Can be rebuilt from events at any time
- Support different query patterns and use cases

> **Pattern Details**: Explore [Projection Patterns](02-architectural-patterns.md#projection-patterns) for architectural approaches and [Projection Implementations](03-implementation-examples.md#projection-patterns-and-implementations) for practical examples.

### 5. Event Handlers/Subscribers
- Components that react to events
- Enable side effects and business process orchestration
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous processing
- Facilitate integration with external systems

## Basic Conceptual Example

Consider a simple **Bank Account** system:

### Traditional CRUD Approach
```sql
-- Only current state is stored
Account { id: 123, balance: 750.00, last_updated: "2025-07-02" }
```

### Event Sourcing Approach
```json
// Event Stream for Account #123
[
  {
    "eventType": "AccountOpened",
    "accountId": "123",
    "initialBalance": 1000.00,
    "timestamp": "2025-07-01T10:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    "eventType": "MoneyWithdrawn",
    "accountId": "123",
    "amount": 250.00,
    "timestamp": "2025-07-02T14:30:00Z"
  }
]

// Current balance derived by replaying events: 1000.00 - 250.00 = 750.00
```

### State Reconstruction
To get the current balance:

1. Load all events for account #123
2. Apply each event in chronological order
3. Calculate final state: Started with $1000, withdrew $250 = $750

## Event Sourcing vs Traditional CRUD

| Aspect | Traditional CRUD | Event Sourcing |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Data Storage** | Current state only | Complete event history |
| **Updates** | In-place modifications | Append-only events |
| **History** | Lost after updates | Fully preserved |
| **Auditability** | Limited or requires additional logging | Built-in complete audit trail |
| **Debugging** | Current state only | Full historical context |
| **Scalability** | Read/write to same tables | Separate write (events) and read (projections) |
| **Consistency** | ACID transactions | Event ordering guarantees |
| **Complexity** | Simpler for basic operations | Higher initial complexity, powerful capabilities |
| **Performance** | Optimized for current state queries | Write-optimized, flexible read patterns |

## When to Use Event Sourcing

> **Decision Framework**: For comprehensive decision frameworks and industry-specific guidance, see [Use Cases and Scenarios](04-use-cases-scenarios.md#decision-framework-when-to-choose-event-sourcing).

**Ideal for domains requiring**:

- Complex business rules with rich state transitions
- Comprehensive audit and compliance requirements
- Temporal analysis and historical reporting
- High-throughput, write-heavy workloads
- Integration with multiple downstream systems
- Support for eventual consistency patterns
- Regulatory compliance with immutable records

> **Industry Examples**: See specific examples in [Financial Technology](04-use-cases-scenarios.md#financial-technology-fintech), [E-Commerce](04-use-cases-scenarios.md#e-commerce-and-retail), and [Healthcare](04-use-cases-scenarios.md#healthcare-and-life-sciences) use cases.

**Consider alternatives when**:

- Simple CRUD operations dominate
- Immediate consistency is critical
- Team lacks experience with event-driven patterns
- Storage costs are a primary concern
- Query patterns are heavily read-optimized for current state

## Relationship to Other Patterns

Event Sourcing commonly integrates with:

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separate write models (events) from read models (projections)
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Events represent domain events from the business
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each service maintains its own event store
- **Saga Pattern**: Coordinate distributed transactions across services
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Events serve as integration points between bounded contexts

> **Architectural Integration**: For detailed patterns and integration strategies, see [CQRS Integration](02-architectural-patterns.md#command-and-query-responsibility-segregation-cqrs), [Microservices Integration](02-architectural-patterns.md#microservices-architecture-integration), and [Implementation Examples](03-implementation-examples.md#integration-patterns).
